# C# Samples for Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera

This documentation provides descriptions of Mech-Eye API C# samples for Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera and instructions for building the samples on Windows.

If you have any questions or have anything to share, feel free to post on the [Mech-Mind Online Community](https://community.mech-mind.com/). The community also contains a [specific category for development with Mech-Eye SDK](https://community.mech-mind.com/c/mech-eye-sdk-development/19).

## Sample List

Samples are divided into the following categories: **Basic**, **Advanced**, and **Util**.

* **Basic** samples: Connect to the camera and acquire data.

## Build the Samples

### Install Required Software

Please download and install the required software listed below.

* [Mech-Eye SDK (latest version)](https://downloads.mech-mind.com/?tab=tab-sdk)
* [Visual Studio (version 2017 or above)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

  > Note: When installing, select the following workloads and individual component.
  >
  >* Workloads in the **Desktop & Mobile** category:
  >
  >   * **.NET desktop development**
  >   * **Desktop development with C++**
  >   * **Universal Windows Platform development**
  >
  >* Individual component: **.NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack**  
  > Caution: C# Mech-Eye API is developed based on .NET Framework 4.8. If .NET Framework 4.8 is not installed, the samples cannot be built.

* Emgu CV: The samples marked with `(OpenCV)` contains functions that depend on the OpenCV software libraries. Therefore, Emgu CV (the .NET wrapper for OpenCV) must be installed through NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio. For detailed instructions, refer to [the guide provided by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio).

### Instructions

1. Double-click **MechEyeCSharpSamples.sln** in the `area_scan_3d_camera` folder.
2. In Visual Studio toolbar, change the solution configuration from **Debug** to **Release**.
3. In the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution**. An EXE format executable file is generated for each sample. The executable files are saved to the `Build` folder, located in the `source` folder.
4. In the **Solution Explorer** panel, right-click a sample, and select **Set as Startup Project**.
5. Click the **Local Windows Debugger** button in the toolbar to run the sample.
6. Enter the index of the camera to which you want to connect, and press the Enter key. The obtained files are saved to the `Build` folder.
